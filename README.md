# PHP-Farcaster-Frame
Farcaster Frame implementation

Simply replace the URLs with your image url and post url.

/get.php will be the link you put in farcaster.

when you hit the button, it will call the post url you put it (which should be /post.php).

You need a webserver, I use IFast for cheap hosting.

If you are doing it on a IFASTNET webserver, just go to manage files.

Put your files in the public_html folder.
